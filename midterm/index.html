                    <p>Extended Reality (XR) in education refers to the integration of <b>virtual reality (VR)</b>,
                        <b>augmented reality (AR)</b>, and <b>mixed reality (MR)</b> technologies to enhance the
                        learning process. XR creates immersive and interactive experiences that bridge the gap between
                        the real and virtual worlds.
                        By leveraging XR, students can engage in simulated environments, interactive simulations, and
                        virtual field trips, allowing for experiential and hands-on learning. For instance, science
                        students can explore the inner workings of cells through immersive VR experiences, while history
                        students can virtually visit historical sites and interact with artifacts through AR. XR in
                        education enhances student engagement and understanding by providing a multisensory and
                        interactive learning environment. Students can manipulate virtual objects, conduct experiments,
                        and collaborate with peers in shared virtual spaces, fostering critical thinking and
                        problem-solving skills.XR expands educational accessibility and inclusivity by breaking down
                        physical barriers. It enables remote learning, bringing educational experiences to students
                        regardless of their geographical location. Additionally, XR accommodates different learning
                        styles and preferences, catering to individual needs and promoting personalized learning
                        experiences.
