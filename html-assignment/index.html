            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am John, a software developer from Hong Kong with a keen interest in hiking, music, coding, and playing
                the guitar. Personally, I am particularly fascinated by XR technology and I am eager to learn design and
                3D skills. Combining my technical expertise with my artistic aspirations, I seek to explore new
                frontiers in the intersection of technology and creativity.</p>
            <p>I'm thinking of studying 3D modeling software such as <strong>Blender</strong>, along with a game engine
                like <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>. It's also worth considering learning about <strong>WebXR</strong>.
